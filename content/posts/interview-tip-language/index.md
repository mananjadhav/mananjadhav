I have taken several interviews, and I would like to share one crucial learning for live coding interviews.

Having proficiency in languages such as Python or Javascript are huge benefits during the live coding sessions. Don't let the familiarity with your primary language overshadow the practicality of using a more interview-friendly one.

While I respect diverse language preferences like Java, C++, Ruby, etc., these might involve writing excessive peripheral code, eating up precious time in an interview. Python and Javascript, on the other hand, offer streamlined implementations with minimal overhead. This is particularly advantageous when tackling various problem statements swiftly within the constraints of interview IDEs.

Trust me; it can make all the difference in acing those live coding sessions!
