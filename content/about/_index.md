I am Manan Jadhav, a technologist and generalist with a decade of experience wearing different hats: engineer, educator, entrepreneur, and past few hours, father of twin toddlers ;)

My career hasn't been a straight line, it's been a thrilling rollercoaster ride across diverse projects, from startups to established players. My whole journey sparked a deep passion for two things: solving problems with technology and building incredible teams.
