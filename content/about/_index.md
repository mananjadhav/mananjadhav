I am Manan Jadhav, a technologist and generalist with a decade of experience wearing different hats: engineer, educator, entrepreneur, and, for the past few hours, a father of twin toddlers ;)

My career hasn't been a straight line; rather, it's been a thrilling rollercoaster ride across diverse projects, ranging from startups to established players. This journey has sparked a deep passion for two things: solving problems with technology and building incredible teams.
