Hi,

I am Manan Jadhav, a technologist, problem-solver and generalist. Over the past decade I have worn many hats: engineer, educator, entrepreneur, and most recently, a father of twin toddlers ;) 

My career hasn't been a straight line; rather, it's been a thrilling rollercoaster ride across diverse projects, ranging from startups to enterprise organizations. This journey has sparked a deep passion for two things: solving problems with technology and building incredible teams.

I love coming up with beautiful technical solutions to difficult challenges and creating amazing teams that make those answers a reality. I enjoy the process of creating and working with others, whether it's delving deeply into code, managing cross-functional teams, or coaching the upcoming generation of developers.


### My journey

- **Engineer:**
Building dependable and scalable applications is the cornerstone of my work. I have engineered solutions end-to-end, spanning the backend, frontend, DevOps, as well as test automation. I have been a polyglot developer with experience in TypeScript, Node.js, Python, PHP, and frontend technologies like React and React Native, along with mobile development for Android and iOS.

- **Educator:** 
I have always had a strong passion for imparting knowledge. From mentoring less experienced developers to recording complex processes, my goal is to make technical ideas understandable to anyone.

- **Entrepreneur:**
I learned tenacity, adaptability, and the skill of striking a balance between speed and quality from my experience in the startup grind. I now have a profound respect for agile development and lean teams as a result of this experience.

- **Technologist:**  
Beyond titles, I’m a tech enthusiast with a passion for leveraging technologies to solve real-world challenges efficiently.


### What I Stand For  

- **Impact through Technology:**
I really think that technology has the capacity to transform lives, and I'm dedicated to applying my expertise to develop solutions that have real impact.  


- **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:**
In my opinion, creating amazing teams is the first step towards creating amazing things. My main goals are to promote a culture of empathy, trust, and lifelong learning.

- **Striving for Excellence:**  
I’m a strong advocate for clean maintainable code. I thrive in the pursuit of optimization – whether it’s refining a query for MongoDB, creating reusable configurations in Terraform, or enhancing API performance.


### On the blog

Here, I document my journey as a technologist and share insights that I hope will inspire or help someone out there. You’ll find me writing about technical deep dives, productivity tips, lessons learned from the trenches, and reflections on leading with purpose.  

Outside of work, I’m discovering the beautiful chaos of parenthood with my twin toddlers, a journey that has taught me more about time management and creativity than any project deadline ever could!
